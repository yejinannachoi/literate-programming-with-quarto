```{python}
#| echo: False

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load the wdi dataset

```

This report analyzes key World Development Indicators (WDI) from 2022 to assess relationships between economic, education, and health variables.


# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Correlation Matrix

To identify meaningful relationships among key indicators, a correlation matrix is created.

```{python}
#| echo: False
#| label: fig-corr-matrix
#| fig-cap: "Heatmap showing the correlation matrix of World Development Indicators in 2022 [@wdi2022]."

# Drop country column and create correlation matrix
corr_matrix = wdi_df.drop(columns=['country'], errors='ignore').corr()

# Plot correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Correlation Matrix of WDI Indicators")
plt.show()
```

- Life expectancy and adult literacy rate have a **strong positive correlation** of **0.69**.
- Life expectancy and GDP per capita also have a **strong positive correlation** of **0.64**.
- Life expectancy and measles immunization rate show a **moderate positive correlation** of **0.56**.

As shown in @fig-corr-matrix, the correlation matrix suggests that higher GDP per capita, literacy rate, and immunization rate are linked to higher life expectancy.

## Summary Statistics

To better understand the distribution of key indicators, summary statistics are computed.

: Summary of Key Descriptive Statistics for Selected Indicators {#tbl-summary-stats}

@tbl-summary-stats provides an overview of key descriptive statistics for selected indicators.

- Life expectancy ranges from **52.99 to 85.38** years with a **mean of 72.42** years.
- GDP per capita varies widely, with values ranging from **$250.63 to $226,052**, suggesting global economic disparities.
- Adult literacy rate remains high, with a **median of 85.45%**, but some countries report much lower rates, reaching as low as 27.28%
- Measles immunization rate varies widely, with some countries reporting as low as **33%**, which may increase the risk of outbreaks.


## Key Indicator Visualizations

### Life Expectancy Distribution
```{python}
#| label: fig-life-exp
#| echo: False
#| fig-cap: "Histogram showing the distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2022 [@wdi2022]."

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.histplot(wdi_df["life_expectancy"], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.xlabel("Life Expectancy (years)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Distribution of Life Expectancy in 2022")
plt.show()
```

- Most countries have a life expectancy between **67 and 82 years**.
- The distribution is **slightly left-skewed**, suggesting that a few countries have significantly lower life expectancy, which could be due to socio-economic instability and lack of healthcare [@Mondal2013].

### 10 Countries with the Lowest Measles Immunization Rates
```{python}
#| label: fig-low-measles
#| echo: False
#| fig-cap: "Bar chart showing the 10 countries with the lowest measles immunization rates in 2022 [@wdi2022]."

# Drop missing values and select the bottom 10
least_immunized_countries = wdi_df.dropna(subset=["measles_immunisation_rate"]).nsmallest(10, "measles_immunisation_rate")

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.barplot(x="measles_immunisation_rate", y="country",
            data=least_immunized_countries,
            hue="country", 
            palette="Blues", 
            legend=False)

plt.xlabel("Measles Immunisation Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Country")
plt.title("10 Countries with Lowest Measles Immunisation Rates (2022)")
plt.xlim(0, 100)
plt.show()
```

The 10 countries with the lowest measles immunization rates have immunization levels **below 55%**, making them more vulnerable to measles outbreaks and other associated health risks.

### GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy and Adult Literacy Rate
```{python}
#| label: fig-gdp-life-literacy
#| echo: False
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplots showing the relationship between GDP per Capita and key indicators in 2022 [@wdi2022]."
#| fig-subcap: ["GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy", "GDP per Capita vs. Adult Literacy Rate"]

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.scatterplot(x=wdi_df["gdp_per_capita"], y=wdi_df["life_expectancy"], alpha=0.6)

plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (years)")
plt.title("GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy (2022)")
plt.xscale("log")  # Log scale for compact data points
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.scatterplot(x=wdi_df["gdp_per_capita"], y=wdi_df["adult_literacy_rate"], alpha=0.6)

plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Adult Literacy Rate (%)")
plt.title("GDP per Capita vs. Adult Literacy Rate (2022)")
plt.ylim(0, 110)  # Literacy rate is between 0-100%
plt.xscale("log")  # Log scale for compact data points
plt.show()
```

There is a clear positive relationship between GDP per capita and **both life expectancy and literacy rate**. Countries with higher GDP per capita generally have longer life expectancy and higher literacy rates. However, some low-GDP countries still achieve high literacy.

## Hypothesis Testing

To determine whether differences in GDP per capita, literacy rate, and immunization rate significantly impact life expectancy, T-tests are performed.

### Life Expectancy and GDP per capita
```{python}
# Remove NaN values before calculating median
df_ttest = wdi_df.dropna(subset=["gdp_per_capita"
                                  , "life_expectancy"])

# Split dataset into High and Low GDP groups based on median GDP
median_gdp = df_ttest["gdp_per_capita"].median()
high_gdp = df_ttest[df_ttest["gdp_per_capita"] >= median_gdp][
    "life_expectancy"]
low_gdp = df_ttest[df_ttest["gdp_per_capita"] < median_gdp][
    "life_expectancy"]

# Run T-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(high_gdp, low_gdp, equal_var=False)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.5f}")
```

- The p-value is < 0.001, so the null hypothesis is rejected.
- There is a **statistically significant difference** in life expectancy between high-GDP and low-GDP countries.

### Life Expectancy and Adult Literacy Rate
```{python}
# Remove NaN values before calculating median
df_ttest = wdi_df.dropna(subset=["adult_literacy_rate"
                                  , "life_expectancy"])

# Split dataset into High and Low adult literacy rate groups based on median rate
median_alr = df_ttest["adult_literacy_rate"].median()
high_alr = df_ttest[df_ttest["adult_literacy_rate"] >= median_alr][
    "life_expectancy"]
low_alr = df_ttest[df_ttest["adult_literacy_rate"] < median_alr][
    "life_expectancy"]

# Run T-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(high_alr, low_alr, equal_var=False)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.5f}")
```

- The p-value is < 0.001, so the null hypothesis is rejected.
- There is a **statistically significant difference** in life expectancy between high-literacy and low-literacy countries.

### Life Expectancy and Measles Immunization Rate
```{python}
# Remove NaN values before calculating median
df_ttest = wdi_df.dropna(subset=["measles_immunisation_rate"
                                  , "life_expectancy"])

# Split dataset into High and Low measles immunization rate groups
# based on median rate
median_mir = df_ttest["measles_immunisation_rate"].median()
high_mir = df_ttest[df_ttest["measles_immunisation_rate"] >= median_mir][
    "life_expectancy"]
low_mir = df_ttest[df_ttest["measles_immunisation_rate"] < median_mir][
    "life_expectancy"]

# Run T-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(high_mir, low_mir, equal_var=False)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.5f}")
```

- The p-value is < 0.001, so the null hypothesis is rejected.
- There is a **statistically significant difference** in life expectancy between countries with high and low measles immunization rates.

### Summary of T-test Findings

| Indicator Compared              | T-Statistic | P-Value | Conclusion                               |
|---------------------------------|------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| High vs. Low GDP per Capita     | 13.643     | <0.001  | Significant difference in life expectancy |
| High vs. Low Adult Literacy Rate | 6.105      | <0.001  | Significant difference in life expectancy |
| High vs. Low Measles Immunization Rate | 7.953  | <0.001  | Significant difference in life expectancy |

: Summary of T-test Findings {#tbl-ttest-results}

As shown in @tbl-ttest-results, the T-test results confirm that GDP per capita, literacy rate, and measles immunization rate are all statistically significantly associated with life expectancy.

## Regression Analysis

A multiple linear regression model is used to examine the relationship between GDP per capita, adult literacy rate, and measles immunization rate with life expectancy.

### Predicting Life Expectancy
```{python}
# Drop rows with NaN values
df_ols = wdi_df.dropna(subset=["gdp_per_capita"
                                , "adult_literacy_rate"
                                , "measles_immunisation_rate"
                                , "life_expectancy"])

# Define dependent and independent variables
X = df_ols[["gdp_per_capita"
            , "adult_literacy_rate"
            , "measles_immunisation_rate"]]
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Add intercept
y = df_ols["life_expectancy"]

# Fit regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Display model summary
model.summary()
```

The regression model provides insights into the predictors of life expectancy. The model explains approximately **58.7 percent of the variability** in life expectancy.

All GDP per capita, adult literacy rate, and measles immunization rate are statistically significant predictors of life expectancy, with **p-values less than 0.05**.

The coefficients of the model suggest that:

- A one-unit increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.0002 increase in life expectancy, controlling for other variables.
- A one-percentage point increase in the adult literacy rate is associated with a 0.1907 increase in life expectancy.
- A one-percentage point increase in the measles immunization rate is associated with a 0.1013 increase in life expectancy.

The exploratory data analysis highlights that **GDP per capita, adult literacy rate, and measles immunization rate are associated with life expectancy**, but this does not imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship.
